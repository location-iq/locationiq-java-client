The Autocomplete API is a variant of the Search API that returns place predictions in response to an HTTP request.  The request specifies a textual search string and optional geographic bounds.  The service can be used to provide autocomplete functionality for text-based geographic searches, by returning places such as businesses, addresses and points of interest as a user types. The Autocomplete API can match on full words as well as substrings. Applications can therefore send queries as the user types, to provide on-the-fly place predictions.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import LocationIq.ApiClient;
import LocationIq.ApiException;
import LocationIq.Configuration;
import LocationIq.auth.*;
import LocationIq.models.*;
import com.locationiq.client.api.AutocompleteApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://eu1.locationiq.com/v1");
    
    // Configure API key authorization: key
    ApiKeyAuth key = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("key");
    key.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //key.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    AutocompleteApi apiInstance = new AutocompleteApi(defaultClient);
    String q = "Empire state"; // String | Address to geocode
    Integer normalizecity = 1; // Integer | For responses with no city value in the address section, the next available element in this order - city_district, locality, town, borough, municipality, village, hamlet, quarter, neighbourhood - from the address section will be normalized to city. Defaults to 1 for SDKs.
    Integer limit = 10; // Integer | Limit the number of returned results. Default is 10.
    String viewbox = "-132.84908,47.69382,-70.44674,30.82531"; // String | The preferred area to find search results.  To restrict results to those within the viewbox, use along with the bounded option. Tuple of 4 floats. Any two corner points of the box - `max_lon,max_lat,min_lon,min_lat` or `min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat` - are accepted in any order as long as they span a real box. 
    Integer bounded = 1; // Integer | Restrict the results to only items contained with the viewbox
    String countrycodes = "us"; // String | Limit search to a list of countries.
    String acceptLanguage = "en"; // String | Preferred language order for showing search results, overrides the value specified in the Accept-Language HTTP header. Defaults to en. To use native language for the response when available, use accept-language=native
    String tag = "place"; // String | Restricts the autocomplete search results to elements of specific OSM class and type.  Example - To restrict results to only class place and type city: tag=place:city, To restrict the results to all of OSM class place: tag=place
    try {
      List<Object> result = apiInstance.autocomplete(q, normalizecity, limit, viewbox, bounded, countrycodes, acceptLanguage, tag);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling AutocompleteApi#autocomplete");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```
