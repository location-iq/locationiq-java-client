Forward Geocoding

The Search API allows converting addresses, such as a street address, into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). These coordinates can serve various use-cases, from placing markers on a map to helping algorithms determine nearby bus stops. This process is also known as Forward Geocoding.

### Example
```java
// Import classes:
import com.locationiq.client.ApiClient;
import com.locationiq.client.ApiException;
import com.locationiq.client.Configuration;
import com.locationiq.client.auth.*;
import com.locationiq.client.models.*;
import com.locationiq.client.api.SearchApi;

public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApiClient defaultClient = Configuration.getDefaultApiClient();
    defaultClient.setBasePath("https://eu1.locationiq.com/v1");
    
    // Configure API key authorization: key
    ApiKeyAuth key = (ApiKeyAuth) defaultClient.getAuthentication("key");
    key.setApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
    // Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
    //key.setApiKeyPrefix("Token");

    SearchApi apiInstance = new SearchApi(defaultClient);
    String q = "Empire state building"; // String | Address to geocode
    String format = "json"; // String | Format to geocode. Only JSON supported for SDKs
    Integer normalizecity = 1; // Integer | For responses with no city value in the address section, the next available element in this order - city_district, locality, town, borough, municipality, village, hamlet, quarter, neighbourhood - from the address section will be normalized to city. Defaults to 1 for SDKs.
    Integer addressdetails = 1; // Integer | Include a breakdown of the address into elements. Defaults to 0.
    String viewbox = "-132.84908,47.69382,-70.44674,30.82531"; // String | The preferred area to find search results.  To restrict results to those within the viewbox, use along with the bounded option. Tuple of 4 floats. Any two corner points of the box - `max_lon,max_lat,min_lon,min_lat` or `min_lon,min_lat,max_lon,max_lat` - are accepted in any order as long as they span a real box. 
    Integer bounded = 1; // Integer | Restrict the results to only items contained with the viewbox
    Integer limit = 10; // Integer | Limit the number of returned results. Default is 10.
    String acceptLanguage = "en"; // String | Preferred language order for showing search results, overrides the value specified in the Accept-Language HTTP header. Defaults to en. To use native language for the response when available, use accept-language=native
    String countrycodes = "us"; // String | Limit search to a list of countries.
    Integer namedetails = 1; // Integer | Include a list of alternative names in the results. These may include language variants, references, operator and brand.
    Integer dedupe = 1; // Integer | Sometimes you have several objects in OSM identifying the same place or object in reality. The simplest case is a street being split in many different OSM ways due to different characteristics. Nominatim will attempt to detect such duplicates and only return one match; this is controlled by the dedupe parameter which defaults to 1. Since the limit is, for reasons of efficiency, enforced before and not after de-duplicating, it is possible that de-duplicating leaves you with less results than requested.
    Integer extratags = 0; // Integer | Include additional information in the result if available, e.g. wikipedia link, opening hours.
    Integer statecode = 0; // Integer | Adds state or province code when available to the statecode key inside the address element. Currently supported for addresses in the USA, Canada and Australia. Defaults to 0
    Integer matchquality = 0; // Integer | Returns additional information about quality of the result in a matchquality object. Read more Defaults to 0 [0,1]
    Integer postaladdress = 0; // Integer | Returns address inside the postaladdress key, that is specifically formatted for each country. Currently supported for addresses in Germany. Defaults to 0 [0,1]
    try {
      List<Location> result = apiInstance.search(q, format, normalizecity, addressdetails, viewbox, bounded, limit, acceptLanguage, countrycodes, namedetails, dedupe, extratags, statecode, matchquality, postaladdress);
      System.out.println(result);
    } catch (ApiException e) {
      System.err.println("Exception when calling SearchApi#search");
      System.err.println("Status code: " + e.getCode());
      System.err.println("Reason: " + e.getResponseBody());
      System.err.println("Response headers: " + e.getResponseHeaders());
      e.printStackTrace();
    }
  }
}
```
